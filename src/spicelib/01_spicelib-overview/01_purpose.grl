#sc2 spicelib-overview_purpose Purpose of the library #sc2

#par The focus for Spicelib is on general utility modules for AS3
development. Furthermore Spicelib serves as a support library for the other Spicefactory projects.
So if you are using Parsley, Pimento or Cinnamon there are always Spicelib modules working
under the hood. But they are completely independent and can be used without these other higher
level frameworks (and also do not depend on each other, with a few exceptions). #par
